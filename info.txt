Problems :

- Shutdown machine & reboot with autologin without physical intervention
- Run Change-Temporary-Password script 

Alternatives : 

- Create a weekly duplicate VM that will execute the Temp Password script
- Create a script that each user has to exeecute at first Startup
	@ In this case the Main VM has to be without password & with autologin enabled
		\ VM will be accessible to the Admin of the Proxmox Server and no one else

To Do :

- Dockerized Burp `run` command
- Dockerized Burp update script
- Decision between Burp & Dockerized Burp
- Kali Lite & Kali Heavy scripts separation
- Calculate Size of the VMs
- Test different compression algorithms to determine the most optimal for VMDK and OVA formats

Info :

- When installing standard version with the normal software packages (medium)
	@ Current Kali occupies : 24-25G
	@ At install and update to latest version : 14G
	@ VMDK Format : 13.8G
	@ Compressed with LZMAA2 with Ultra Settings and max dictionnary size for 16G of RAM : 13.4G
